== Security

The information present in SIP requests often contains sensitive user
  information. To protect user information, SIP Security can be enabled on the
  server, and within the SIP application to mitigate the risk of unauthorised
  access to the information.

There are essentially two levels of security that can be enabled on
  the server, the communication between the server and other SIP entities and
  securing the application and its content.

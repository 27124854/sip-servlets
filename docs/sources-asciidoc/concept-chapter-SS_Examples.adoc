The SIP Servlet Server has a selection of examples that demonstrate particular capabilities of the server. <<_tab_ssea_sip_servlet_example_applications>> lists the available examples, their location, and a brief description about the functionality each example demonstrates.
The examples can also provide a useful starting point for developing SIP Applications, therefore it is encouraged to experiment and adapt the base examples.
Each example is available in both binary and source formats.

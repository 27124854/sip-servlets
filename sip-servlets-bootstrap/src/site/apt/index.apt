Goals  

  Mobicents Sip Servlets delivers a consistent, open platform on which to develop and deploy portable and distributable SIP and Converged JEE services.\ 
  It is the first open source certified implementation of the SIP Servlet v1.1 (JSR 289 Spec) on top of Tomcat & JBoss containers and 
  strive to feature best performances, security, foster innovation and develop interoperability standards between Sip Servlets and JSLEE so that applications 
  may exploit the strengths of both. 
  {{{http://jain-sip.dev.java.net}The JAIN-SIP Reference implementation}} is leveraged as the SIP stack and 
  {{{./products_jain_slee.html}Mobicents JAIN SLEE}} is used as the SLEE implementation.
